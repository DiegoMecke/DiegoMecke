# Bachelor Thesis : Introduction to ML and Neural Network

## Abstract

This project will aim to analyse Neural Networks. Starting from
Machine Learningâ€™s basic concepts to the underlying structures of Deep Neural Networks.

During the development of the Machine Learning topic, the concepts and
basic notions will be introduced step by step, starting with the type of data
to work with till the different resolution methods.

Considering these notions, the Neural Network subject will be presented including an historical introduction and explanation of its firsts models.
In order to solve different classification problems, an implementation of the
Multilayer Perceptron model will be done in Python language.

Afterwards, the Deep Neural Networks and their diverse optimizers will
be analyzed, as well as the way they modify their performance and the oc-
currence of problems such as overfitting or exploding/vanishing gradients.

Finally, the mentioned concepts of the Deep Neural Network and the
Keras package in Python will be used with various Deep Neural Network
models to analyse different problems which require more complex structures
in order to be solved.
